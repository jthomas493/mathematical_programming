# 📊 Optimization Projects: Modeling and Solving with Python PuLP

This repository contains a collection of **Linear Programming (LP)** and **Non-Linear Programming (NLP)** models formulated and solved using the **PuLP** library in **Python**. These projects are directly inspired by the modeling techniques detailed in **"Model Building in Mathematical Programming" by H. Paul Williams**, demonstrating expertise in translating real-world scenarios into mathematical optimization frameworks and efficiently solving them using code.
